# Nanobody-Protease
Used IgFold for de novo prediction of therapeutic nanobody structures and binding energy/machine learning-based protein-protein docking models (e.g., HDOCK and DiffDock-PP, respectively) to investigate interactions between nanobodies and cancer-associated fibroblast activation proteins
